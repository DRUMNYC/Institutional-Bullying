I was being bullied by a classmate and I told a teacher about it but they did not take it seriously. The bullied ended up getting worse and the classmate and I got into a fight in the cafeteria. We were both suspended by the school. Once I got back we needed up getting into another fight and this time the school put us both in peer mediation. During the peer mediation we were Abel to resolve our issues and things got better. Why didn't the school use peer mediation first instead if automatically suspending me?
