---

Following an online altercation with a classmate and it escalating in school, The student and I were called into the guidance counselors office and my parents were called to come in. My father had to take a day off from work to come into school but the conversation was not translated into our language. He didn't understand anything and I was given a detention without any explanation from the school.
