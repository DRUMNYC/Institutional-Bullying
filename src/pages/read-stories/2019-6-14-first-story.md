I got a call from my son's school that he was **injured and being taken to the hospital**. I tried asking what had happened and the school didn't give me much details. I ended up going to the hospital to find my **son bleeding from his finger**. When I asked what happened he said the school security and dean tried to stop him and search his bag because he smelled like weed. He didn't feel comfortable and was trying to leave the school and **they ended up closing the door on his hand**. **They had no right to put their hands on my son**. He had to get stitches and I had to take time off work to deal with this situation. The school did not give me the full suspension packet. The school is also saying that my son is not going to graduate because he didn't do his work in the suspension school but when I talked to the teacher in the suspension school they said he was completing his work.
